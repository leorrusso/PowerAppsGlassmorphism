Glassmorphism is a design trend that brings a sense of transparency, depth, and realism to user interfaces. It combines frosted glass-like backgrounds, subtle gradients, and soft shadows to create a visually appealing and intuitive user experience. In this repository, we have implemented glassmorphism principles to create a stunning mobile interface for your Power Apps projects.

To emulate the glassmorphism effect using native components of Power Apps, I utilized the HTML object and image components to create the illusion of glassmorphism within the app interface. By strategically positioning and styling these components, I was able to achieve a frosted glass-like background effect. The HTML object component allowed me to overlay a translucent layer with a blurred background image, mimicking the characteristic transparency of glass. Additionally, I utilized the image component to display gradient overlays and soft shadows, enhancing the depth and realism of the glassmorphism effect. By leveraging the native capabilities of Power Apps and creatively manipulating these components, I successfully replicated the visual aesthetics of glassmorphism, creating an elegant and modern user interface.

At the time this component was created "backdrop-filter" was not a property available in Power Apps.
